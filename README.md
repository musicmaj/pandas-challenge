# pandas-challenge
This pandas challenge analyzes school testing data to determine trends with student standardized test scores.
I was able to perform calculations and create high-level snapshots for the districts key metrics in a DataFrame.
Next, I performed calculations to create a snapshot with key metrics about each school and placed them in another DataFrame.
With the key metrics into DataFrames, I could then sort out the top 5 schools by the percentage of students passing both reading and math. This also allowed for finding the lowest 5 schools by the percentage of students passing both reading and math.
I was able to utilize the groupby function to show scores by grade for the district, and I was also able to utilize pd.cut with bins and labels for a greater snapshot on funding, school size, and school type alongside the test scores.
The assignment also includes a written report of my analysis in pdf or txt format as well as a folder with images from the DataFrames that were created.
The Xpert Learning Assistant was queried throughout this assignment to ask questions of, and portions of code that were specifically taken from the Xpert are listed with a # Note within the code blocks.
